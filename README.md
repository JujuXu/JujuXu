### 🤖 **Remote Controlled Robot with Arm | 2023-2024**
A **third-year project** where we designed and built a remote-controlled robot from scratch!  
- **Custom-made electronics:** We were forbidden to use premade Arduino boards, so we designed our own.
- **Software integration:** Controlled via a **JavaFX** interface.
