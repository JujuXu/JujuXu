## About me

I'm Julien, a 21 year old electronics engineer student, at [HELHa](https://www.helha.be/).

During my formation, I've learned multiple skills, such as electronics, PCB designing, robotics and projects management.

## Projects
> Robotix's Contest | 2024-2025

We're competing for the HELHa's engineer school, we're a team of 3 electronics engineer students and 2 electromechanical engineer students.

The aim of the project is to build a main robot and 3 smaller ones to reach some objectives inside an arena, such as collecting cans and planks to build something with, deploy a banner, etc...

> Remote controlled robot with arm | 2023-2024

Third-year project where we had to create our first remote controlled robot, from scratch. We were forbidden to use premade Arduino boards so we had to build ours. It was controlled with a JavaFX interface.

> Electric Ground Sieve | 2022-2023

Second-year project in collaboration with Protect'Eau company. We had to design a sieve to help farmers sieving samples faster.

> MRI Simulator for children | 2021-2022

First-year project for an hospital (GHdC Notre Dame). We had to design a 3/4 MRI to accustom children to take this kind of medical examination.
